About this course

This course is aimed at users with little or no Linux knowledge. The main objective is to get you comfortable working on a linux system using the command line.

The focus on the command line is for two reasons:

1. You have may already have access to a large RAM or multi core linux machine via your department.

2. You want to make use of the large HPCS compute clusters for data analysis. Whilst we run an introduction to HPC course some basic linux skills are a pre-requisite.

If you intention is to run Linux on the desktop this course will cover some but not everything you need.

Learning environment

The course will be delivered using the teaching facilities Linux desktops, the course material webslte and some slides / demonstrations. 

The format of the the course is that for each topic there will be 15-20 minutes of slides / lecturing and then 40 minutes for self paced learning with instructor help. 

The exercises and course material are available online. You will be able to access them outside of the course and work at your own pace. The only requirement other than the teaching material is access to a linux terminal and this could be either a remote machine or a virtual one.
I have made a short video showing how to setup Ubuntu Linux as a virtual machine in virtual box. If you don\'92t have access to a Linux machine then a VM is a good way to set one up on your own laptop. 

Virtual box and Ubuntu can be downloaded for free.
